# Simple Calculator

I wanted a calculator.    
A calculator.   

Couldn't find one without ads or stupid features that used phone memory.     

So I forked SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calculator and removed all the non-calculator features.     

Now I have what I want: Simply a pure calculator.

I published it to google play -> <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xanadu.calculator'><img src='https://simplemobiletools.com/assets/images/google-play.png' alt='Get it on Google Play' height=45/></a>
